# Code Implementation Orchestrator

This skill coordinates the development flow of subagents handling issue tickets in Revit API Synthetic v2. The **Orchestrator Agent** coordinates activities, manages the issue queue/frontier, reviews subagent plans, enforces MSBuild and test execution locks, merges feature branches, and posts the final summary walkthrough on the primary parent issue upon completion. **Subagents** perform planning, implementation using `/implement` and `/tdd` (via Revit test executor), post-implementation `/code-review` (by spawning dedicated review subagents), milestone artifact posting on their assigned issue, defect breakdown, and child ticket closure.

---

## Orchestrator Agent Process

1. **Map dependencies**: Discover target issues via `gh` CLI (`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`) and build the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using native GitHub issue dependencies (`issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by`) or `Blocked by: #XX` headers.
   * *Completion Criterion*: A complete DAG of all scoped issues with identified parent/child and blocking edges.

2. **Identify frontier issues**: Query the DAG for open issues that have no open blockers and no assignees.
   * *Completion Criterion*: A list of unblocked, unassigned frontier issues ready for immediate work.

3. **Manage the queue & spawn subagents**: Assign each frontier issue (`gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`) and spawn subagents using `invoke_subagent` with `Workspace: "share"` (Git worktrees). Direct subagents to acquire build/test locks before compilation/testing, spawn separate review subagents when running `/code-review`, and post milestone artifacts to their assigned issue.
   * *Completion Criterion*: Subagents spawned on isolated Git branches (`ticket-<number>`) for all available frontier slots with strict subagent-spawning, resource locking, and milestone commenting directives.

4. **Manage resources & review plans**: Enforce subagent concurrency caps (2–4 active agents). Enforce MSBuild compilation and Revit test execution locks (serializing build and test commands across subagents to prevent `output/Synthetic/` write locks or registry conflicts). Review subagent implementation plans against `CONTEXT.md` (domain vocabulary per `docs/agents/domain.md`), parent issue/spec, and repository standards (including Revit skills like `revit-multi-versions`, `revit-transactions`, `revit-wpf-mvvm`). Provide feedback until satisfied, then approve the plan and release the subagent.
   * *Completion Criterion*: Approved plan attached to the GitHub issue as a comment and subagent released for development.

5. **Merge commits & update DAG**: Once a subagent reports a ticket is defect-free and closed, verify that its branch compiles clean and passes tests across supported Revit versions (`python .agents/skills/revit-tests/scripts/test_executor.py`), merge the ticket's feature branch into the target integration branch (`develop`), recalculate the dependency frontier, and repeat.
   * *Completion Criterion*: Ticket branch verified, merged into integration branch, DAG updated, and next frontier queued.

6. **Post primary issue walkthrough & close parent**: Once all child sub-issues under a primary parent issue are completed and merged, aggregate the overall work into a comprehensive final walkthrough comment on the **primary parent issue** (`gh issue comment <parent-number> --body "..."`) and close the primary issue.
   * *Completion Criterion*: Primary parent issue closed with an aggregated summary walkthrough comment.

---

## Subagent Process

1. **Formulate & post implementation plan**: Formulate an implementation plan for the assigned ticket (referring to `CONTEXT.md` / `docs/agents/domain.md` for domain vocabulary and parent issue/spec). Submit the plan to the orchestrator for review. Once approved, post the plan as a comment on the assigned GitHub issue (`gh issue comment <n> --body "..."`), scrubbing any sensitive information (tokens, credentials, internal paths).
   * *Completion Criterion*: Orchestrator-approved implementation plan posted as an issue comment on GitHub.

2. **Implement assigned issue**: Run `/implement` on the assigned ticket using `/tdd` following the `revit-tests` execution sequence (headless Logic tests -> `CURRENT_LATEST_VERSION` tests -> multi-version validation). Acquire build/test locks from the orchestrator before executing compilation or test runs.
   * *Completion Criterion*: Code changes implemented, tested with `/tdd`, and passing logic and Revit version tests (`python .agents/skills/revit-tests/scripts/test_executor.py`).

3. **Post implementation walkthrough**: Produce a post-implementation walkthrough detailing code changes made and verification results. Post the walkthrough as a comment on the assigned GitHub issue, scrubbing any sensitive information.
   * *Completion Criterion*: Implementation walkthrough posted as an issue comment on GitHub.

4. **Perform Code Review via spawned subagents**: Execute `/code-review` by **spawning separate parallel subagents** via `invoke_subagent` (one for Standards review and one for Spec review). **Do NOT perform the code review inline within your own conversation.**
   * *Completion Criterion*: Parallel review subagents spawned and their two-axis report (Standards & Spec) collected.

5. **Post Code Review report as comment**: Post the aggregated `/code-review` report as a comment on the assigned GitHub issue, scrubbing any sensitive information.
   * *Completion Criterion*: Cleaned `/code-review` report posted as an issue comment on GitHub.

6. **Route defects & human review tickets**:
   - **6.1. Human review tickets**: If judgement calls (design smells, architectural choices) are needed, create a sub-issue with the `ready-for-human` (or `wayfinder:grilling`) label per `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` and post a reference comment.
   - **6.2. Defect classification**: For defects ready for agent implementation (`ready-for-agent`), determine if multiple tickets are needed:
     - **6.2.1. Multiple tickets**: Run `/to-tickets` to publish tracer-bullet subissues on the current ticket.
     - **6.2.2. Single ticket/comment**: Add the defect description and fix task directly as a comment to the issue.
   - **6.3. Implement defects**: Run `/implement` to resolve all direct defects (from comments or subissues).
   * *Completion Criterion*: Judgement call tickets created if needed, direct defects identified and implemented.

7. **Repeat Code Review loop**: Re-run Steps 4–6 (spawning new parallel review subagents for `/code-review`, posting updated `/code-review` comments, and implementing fixes) after defect fixes until the branch is completely defect-free (0 direct defects).
   * *Completion Criterion*: `/code-review` from spawned review subagents returns zero direct defects on both Standards and Spec axes.

8. **Post ticket walkthrough & close child issue**: Post a walkthrough comment on the assigned ticket summarizing its specific implementation and close the ticket (`gh issue close <number>`) once defect-free and all blocking human review tickets are accounted for.
   * *Completion Criterion*: Assigned ticket state updated to `closed` on GitHub with its specific walkthrough comment.

## Orchestrator Agent Detailed Explanations

### Step 1: Map Dependencies
* **Discovery Modes**:
  - *Parent Issue Mode*: Fetch the parent issue and all sub-issues via `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>/sub_issues`.
  - *Custom Group Mode*: Fetch specified issue numbers using `gh issue view <number> --comments`.
  - *Frontier Mode*: Fetch all open issues with label `ready-for-agent` (`gh issue list --label ready-for-agent --state open`).
* **DAG Construction**: Query native GitHub issue dependencies via `gh api`. Read `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by`. Fall back to parsing `Blocked by: #XX` lines in issue bodies where native links are absent.

### Step 2: Identify Frontier Issues
* Filter the DAG for open tickets where `blocked_by` count is 0 and no assignee is assigned (`assignees` list is empty).
* Sort tickets by priority or map order. These constitute the active frontier.

### Step 3: Manage Queue & Spawn Subagents
* Claim each frontier issue before spawning (`gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`).
* Spawn a subagent via `invoke_subagent` using the `implement` skill with `Workspace: "share"`. This provisions an isolated Git worktree so subagents work on dedicated branches (`ticket-<number>`) without workspace collisions.
* **Directives to Subagent**: Explicitly instruct the spawned subagent: *"Post artifacts as comments at each milestone (approved plan, implementation walkthrough, and code review reports). Acquire build/test locks from the orchestrator before compiling or running tests. When implementation is complete, you MUST spawn separate parallel subagents to run `/code-review` (Standards and Spec axes). Do NOT perform the code review yourself inline."*

### Step 4: Manage Resources & Review Plans
* **Concurrency Cap**: Maintain 2–4 active subagents maximum to prevent system CPU/memory exhaustion.
* **Build & Test Lock Protocol**: While Git worktrees isolate source files, MSBuild compilation writes to a common output path (`output/Synthetic/`) and `guid_whitelister.py` updates system registry keys for Revit testing. The Orchestrator serializes compilation (`MSBuild.exe`) and test execution (`test_executor.py`) across subagents via a FIFO lock queue so only one subagent compiles or runs tests at a time.
* **Plan Review**: Subagents must submit implementation plans to the orchestrator before editing code. Check plans against `CONTEXT.md` domain vocabulary (per `docs/agents/domain.md`), parent spec constraints, test seams, and Revit skills (`revit-multi-versions`, `revit-transactions`, `revit-wpf-mvvm`, etc.). Provide feedback if incomplete; once approved, post the plan to the GitHub issue (`gh issue comment <n> --body "..."`) and release the subagent.

### Step 5: Merge Commits & Update DAG
* When a subagent closes its ticket, verify that its branch compiles clean and tests pass across supported versions (`python .agents/skills/revit-tests/scripts/test_executor.py`).
* Merge the ticket's feature branch into the target integration branch (`develop`).
* Recalculate the DAG, unblock downstream tickets whose dependencies are now closed, and populate the next frontier.

### Step 6: Post Primary Issue Walkthrough & Close Parent
* When operating on a primary issue with subissues (Parent Issue Mode), the orchestrator holds high-level responsibility for the primary issue.
* Once all child sub-issues are closed and merged:
  1. Aggregate the walkthroughs, code review results, and verification metrics from all child sub-issues into one unified, high-level summary walkthrough.
  2. Post this aggregated walkthrough as a comment on the **primary parent issue** (`gh issue comment <parent-number> --body "..."`).
  3. Close the primary parent issue (`gh issue close <parent-number> --comment "All sub-issues completed and verified"`).

## Subagent Detailed Explanations

### Step 1: Formulate & Post Implementation Plan
* Check `CONTEXT.md` (per `docs/agents/domain.md`) to align all naming with ubiquitous domain vocabulary.
* Read the assigned ticket body, comments, and the **parent issue / spec** for surrounding architectural context.
* Review relevant Revit skills (`revit-multi-versions`, `revit-transactions`, `revit-wpf-mvvm`, `revit-extensible-storage`, `revit-failure-handling`) to ensure design alignment.
* Formulate an implementation plan and submit it to the orchestrator for review.
* **Post Plan Comment**: Once approved by the orchestrator, post the plan as a comment to the assigned GitHub issue (`gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`). Scrub sensitive information (tokens, credentials, local user paths).

### Step 2: Implement Assigned Issue
* Use `/implement` with `/tdd` following the `revit-tests` execution sequence:
  1. **Step 1 (Logic Loop)**: Run headless logic tests (`python .agents/skills/revit-tests/scripts/test_executor.py --version Logic`).
  2. **Step 2 (Latest Revit Loop)**: Run integration tests for `CURRENT_LATEST_VERSION` from `docs/agents/revit-config.md` (e.g. `2026`).
  3. **Step 3 (Multi-Version Validation)**: Validate across all supported Revit versions (`python .agents/skills/revit-tests/scripts/test_executor.py`).
* **Tool Constraint**: Always use direct built-in file-editing tools (`replace_file_content`, `multi_replace_file_content`, `write_to_file`). Do NOT write or execute Python, PowerShell, or CLI scripts to perform search-and-replace or edit code files.
* Acquire build/test lock from the orchestrator before executing compilation or test commands to avoid MSBuild output directory and registry lock collisions.

### Step 3: Post Implementation Walkthrough
* After implementation completes and tests pass, summarize the changes made, files touched, and test results into a walkthrough document.
* **Post Walkthrough Comment**: Post the walkthrough as a comment on the assigned GitHub issue (`gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`), scrubbing sensitive information.

### Step 4 & 5: Code Review Execution & Comment Posting
* **Mandatory Subagent Spawning for `/code-review`**: You MUST NOT perform code reviews inline within your own context window. In strict accordance with `/code-review` (Step 4), spawn two separate parallel subagents via `invoke_subagent`:
  1. **Standards Subagent**: Evaluates diff against repo standards, Revit API practices, and Fowler code smells.
  2. **Spec Subagent**: Evaluates diff against requirements in the assigned ticket and parent spec.
* **Post Code Review Comment**: Collect the outputs from both review subagents and post the aggregated two-axis report (Standards & Spec) verbatim as an issue comment (`gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`), scrubbing sensitive information.

### Step 6: Route Defects & Human Review Tickets
* **6.1 Human Review Tickets**: Identify subjective design smells or architectural trade-offs. Create linked sub-issues labeled `ready-for-human` (or `wayfinder:grilling`) per `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` and post a reference comment on the issue.
* **6.2 Defect Breakdown**:
  - *Multi-ticket defects (6.2.1)*: If defects span multiple distinct components or tracer bullets, run `/to-tickets` to break them into sub-issues attached to the current ticket.
  - *Single-ticket/comment defects (6.2.2)*: If defects are small and localized, write the defect checklist directly into a comment on the current issue.
* **6.3 Implement Defects**: Execute `/implement` on the defect tasks (from subissues or comment checklist) on the ticket branch.

### Step 7: Repeat Code Review Loop Until Defect-Free
* After committing defect fixes, **spawn new parallel subagents** to re-run `/code-review`.
* **Post Updated Code Review Comment**: Post each updated review report as a comment on the issue.
* Repeat the `/code-review` (via subagents) ➔ post review comment ➔ fix defects cycle until `/code-review` returns zero direct defects on both Standards and Spec axes.

### Step 8: Post Ticket Walkthrough & Close Child Issue
* Compile a ticket completion walkthrough summarizing the overall resolution, final test suite results across supported Revit versions, and closed defect state for the assigned issue.
* Scrub sensitive data and post the walkthrough as a comment on the assigned issue.
* Close the assigned issue on GitHub (`gh issue close <number> --comment "Completed via orchestrate-implement"`).
